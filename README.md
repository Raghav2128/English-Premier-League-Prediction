# ‚öΩ English Premier League Match Outcome Predictor

Predict the outcome of football matches using machine learning ‚Äî trained on real historical match data.

---

## üß† Project Overview

This project explores how machine learning can be applied to football analytics by predicting match outcomes: Home Win, Draw, or Away Win. It includes two key parts:

1. **Data Collection:** Scrape Premier League data (fixtures, results, shooting stats) from FBref using Python and BeautifulSoup.
2. **Prediction:** Use the scraped and cleaned dataset to train a logistic regression model and evaluate its accuracy.

The goal of this project was both educational and practical: to gain experience in data preprocessing, feature encoding, and model evaluation using real-world sports data.
