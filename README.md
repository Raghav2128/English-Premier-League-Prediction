# ⚽ English Premier League Match Outcome Predictor

Predict the outcome of football matches using machine learning — trained on real historical match data.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project explores how machine learning can be applied to football analytics by predicting match outcomes: Home Win, Draw, or Away Win. Using a clean and structured dataset, we train a logistic regression model to learn from past match data and evaluate its performance using accuracy and a confusion matrix.

The goal of this project was both educational and practical: to gain experience in data preprocessing, feature encoding, and model evaluation using real-world sports data.
